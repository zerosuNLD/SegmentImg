# Satellite Image Segmentation using U-Net

This project implements a U-Net model to perform **semantic segmentation** on satellite images, classifying each pixel into categories such as **road, building, vegetation, water**, etc.

## 🔍 Overview

- **Model:** U-Net (fully convolutional network)
- **Dataset:** Satellite Image Classification (Kaggle)
- **Technologies:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Data Augmentation, One-hot Encoding
- **Result:** ~80% IoU on the test set
